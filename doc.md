# The Oregon Trail Clone
## Project Plan
This is where we will have the structure of the game.
### Phase 1: Setup & Prototyping
* **Create the project in Godot:** Make an empty project folder.
* **Structure repo:** Add folders: assets/ (art, sounds), scenes/ (Godot scenes), scripts/ (GDScript files), docs/ (plans).
* **Create main:** One main Node2D or Control node to hold everything.
* **Prototype = experiment:** Make quick placeholder nodes: a Label to show text, a Button for choices.
* **Test basic flow:** Intro text -> player choice -> show result.

### Phase 2: Core Mechanics Development
* Add player variables: food, health, money, days.
* Write travel code: every "turn" (click) reduces food, moves days forward.
* Make random event generator: sickness, broken wheel, etc.
* Add choices: buttons that changes player stats based on choice.

### Phase 3: Asset Creation
* Draw characters, animals, wagons in Aseprite or Piskel.
* Make tiny background scenes: grassland, river crossing.
* Make UI icons: heart for health, bread for food.
* Compose simple chiptune: loop for travel, short event music.

### Phase 4: Integration and Polishing
* Replace prototype text/images with real pixel art.
* Play music automatically in scenes.
* Connect sound effects to button presses or events.
* Adjust random event chances for fun balance.
* Style UI: bigger font, clean buttons, color palette.

### Phase 5: Testing and Release
* Test on your own: try weird choices, check for bugs.
* Get brother to test: note bugs, confusing parts.
* Ask friends/family to try and review.
* Tweak art/audio if needed.
* Write clear instructions: how to play, what to do.
* Upload to itch.io: add screenshots, description, credits.
